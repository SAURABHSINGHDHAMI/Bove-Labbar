# Introduction to DBMS

## What is Data?

- Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions of things etc.

  In other words, **data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself**.

  Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes – which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing.

- Data can be recorded and doesn’t have any meaning unless processed.

## Types of Data

1. **Quantitative**
   - Numerical form
   - Weight, volume, cost of an item.

2. **Qualitative**
   - Descriptive, but not numerical.
   - Name, gender, hair color of a person.

## What is Information?

- Info. Is **processed, organized, and structured data**.

- It provides **context of the data and enables decision making**.

- Processed data that make **sense** to us.

- Information is extracted from the data, by **analyzing and interpreting** pieces of data.

- E.g. you have data of all the people living in your locality, its Data, when you analyze and interpret the data and come to some conclusion that:
  - There are 100 senior citizens.
  - The sex ratio is 1:1.
  - Newborn babies are 100.
  
  These are information.

## Data vs Information

- Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.

- While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.

- Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together.

- Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful information.

- Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.

- Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. Information is typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.

- Data isn’t sufficient for **decision-making**, but you can make decisions based on information.

## What is Database?

- Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be **easily accessed, managed, and updated**.

- To make real use Data, we need **Database management systems (DBMS)**.

---

## What is DBMS?

- A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of **interrelated data** and **a set of programs to access those data**.

  The collection of data, usually referred to as the **database**, contains information relevant to an enterprise.

  The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to **store and retrieve database information** that is both convenient and efficient.

- A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality.

  It is used to perform different operations, like **addition, access, updating,** and **deletion** of the data.

## DBMS vs File Systems

- **File-processing systems** has major **disadvantages**.
  - Data Redundancy and inconsistency
  - Difficulty in accessing data
  - Data isolation
  - Integrity problems
  - Atomicity problems
  - Concurrent-access anomalies
  - Security problems
